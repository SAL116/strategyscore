Welcome to our the data appendix of our paper "Measuring Founding Strategy".  This paper offers a new, systematic, way to measure business strategy using natural language processing tools and ‘big data’.   Then, it implements this approach in the context of entrepreneurship, to estimate a score of the founding strategy of startups for a large sample of startups in Crunchbase.   Finally, we use our estimated strategy scores to clarify some key relationships between strategic positioning at founding and firm performance.  


In this repo, you will find the code we have used to download all the original webpages of the startups, calculate the strategy score for each startup, and the resulting word weights.  We hope you find it useful, and we are excited to share it with the community.  Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any question.s
